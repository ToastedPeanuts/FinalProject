## Description
I would like to create a small text adventure game that has has multiple routes/endings.
This is very relevant to media and digital arts as it is a good building block for games. 

## Features
- Paths
	- Players are given an 2 options of 'Right' or 'Left', the initial and then the second after
   	the initial conversation is done
- Characters
	- An image of the monster/person encountered will be visible while in that encounter.
   	-2 Monsters and 2 People
- Input from Player
	- Input a name to follow through game. Monsters/person will address the player by name.
-Choices
  	-Choices made by the player will determine the ending. The endings are 'Good' and 'Bad'.
- Randomized encounters
 	 -Encounters randomized to be either friendly or hostile. Players can fight/talk to the monsters
  	as well as the people.

(To attempt)
-Create a music track to follow through game
-Possbily create different scores for encounters with monsters and with charactes.

## Challenges
- Taking an input from a player and integrating it into the game.
- Having an image appear at an encounter and disappear at the end of the encounter.
- Creating an array for the choices made and creating a final 'verdict' at the end
  based on the array
- Randomizing each encounters initial conversation to either be friendly or hostile
  towards player
-Players given the choice to go 'Right' or 'Left' and the decision will lead them to
  a monster or a person
-Players given the choice to be friendly or hostile towards NPCS.
-2 normal encounters and 1 final 'discussion of actions', ie were you good or bad
  during the game

  (To attempt)
  -Create music and integrate it for while the game runs.
  -Change the music based on who the player is talking with.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
The ideal outcome for this project is to have a short text adventure game that I can
use to display my coding ability in Python. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- All the interactions in the game should correctly lead to the final outcome given.
- Inputs from the player should follow through the game

## Milestones

- Week 1 - 11/12/23-11/19/23
  1. Initilization of the game X
  2. Input from the player- Name & Paths X
  3. Basic display screen for the game X
  4. Set up structures for encounters with 5 characters X

- Week 2 - 11/19/23-11/26/23
  1. Create friendly/hostile initial conversation for 4 characters
  2. Create friendly/hostile responses for the player for 4 characters
  3. Randomizing the initial conversations
  4. Create an array for player actions
  5. Create Final outcome conversation

- Week 3 - 11/26/23-12/3/23 (DUE)
  1. Connect all the paths together with inputs- Should correctly lead
     to the final outcome X
  2. Display images on encounters
  3. Animate text X
  4. (Add music)
  5. (Different music based on encounters)
