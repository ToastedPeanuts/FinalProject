## Description
I would like to create a small text adventure game that has has multiple routes/endings.
This is very relevant to media and digital arts as it is a good building block for games. 

## Features
- Paths
	- Players are given an initial option of 'Right' or 'Left' and given the option again
   after the first encounter 
- Characters
	- An image of the monster/character encountered will be visible while in that encounter
- Input from Player
	- Input a name to follow through game. Monsters/characters will address the player by name.
-Choices
  -Choices made by the player will determine the ending. The endings are 'Good' and 'Bad'.
- Randomized encounters
  -Encounters randomized to be either friendly or hostile. Players can fight/talk the monsters
  as well as the characters.

(To attempt)
-Create a music track to follow through game
-Possbily create different scores for encounters with monsters and with charactes.

## Challenges
- Taking an input from a player and integrating it into the game.
- Having an image appear at an encounter and disappear at the end of the encounter.
- Creating an array for the choices made and creating a final 'verdict' at the end
  based on the array
- Randomizing each encounters initial conversation to either be friendly or hostile
  towards player
-Players given the choice to go 'Right' or 'Left' and the decision will lead them to
  a monster or a person
-Players given the choice to be friendly or hostile towards NPCS.
-2 normal encounters and 1 final 'discussion of actions', ie were you good or bad
  during the game

  (To attempt)
  -Create music and integrate it for while the game runs.
  -Change the music based on who the player is talking with.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
The ideal outcome for this project is to have a short text adventure game that I can
use to display my coding ability in Python. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- All the interactions in the game should correctly lead to the final outcome given.
- Inputs from the player should follow through the game
