Description

This project is a text adventure that has three different endings determined by your choices.
The file that I have included is the background music for the game. This game includes animated
text, multiple ways to stop the program, saving inputs and using them through the game, background music, randomized encounters, and a descriptive story. I did have to look multiple things up as well as learn how to reset to a different pull request to fix what I broke. This mini-game was difficult and rather long, but I am proud of how it turned out. I can absolutely work on readability as well as commenting through the code. I very much struggled with images in pygame so I will be working on strengthening that.
